            "Deep tissue massage focuses on reaching the deeper layers of muscles and connective tissue to release chronic tension and stubborn knots. Using slower strokes and firmer pressure, this treatment helps break up adhesions, improve mobility, and relieve long-standing areas of discomfort. It’s especially beneficial for people who experience muscle tightness from stress, postural strain, or athletic training. Many clients leave feeling both lighter and looser, with improved circulation and a greater sense of physical balance.",
